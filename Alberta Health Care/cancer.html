        All the cancer treatment modalities are available here, including:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Surgical Oncology (with site-specific teams)</li>
            <li>Medical Oncology (chemotherapy & targeted therapy for all common cancer sites)</li>
            <li>Radiation Oncology/ Radiotherapy (with state-of-the-art facilities for both teletherapy & brachytherapy)</li>
            <li>Hemato-oncology (for treatment of blood cancers, including a soon-to-start Bone Marrow Transplant Unit)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Cancer calls for multi-modality therapy and frequently specialists from all the branches of oncology are involved in the care of the cancer patient. It is essential that every patient is seen after diagnosis by all the specialists who can then chalk out an optimal treatment plan. This is why, we have a Multidisciplinary Tumor Board for all cancer patients, attended by the relevant members of the oncology team.</p>
